# Career-and-Job-Scraping-Agent-using-K-nearest-Neighbor-in-Python-
 Implement a simple “Career and Job Center” agent using Python. The agent accepts a list of free-form keywords from the command line and outputs Career and Job opportunities that most closely match the input keywords. The agent uses the nearest Neighbors algorithm to find matches for every given value of k.
